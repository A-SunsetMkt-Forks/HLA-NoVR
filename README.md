# HLA-NoVR
NO VR Script for Half-Life: Alyx

## Installation
Copy the ``game`` folder into your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx``).

Steam Deck/Linux users need to enable Proton for both Half-Life: Alyx and the mod in order for the game to work (``game\bin\win64\novr.exe``) and also add the launch option ``-processheap``.
## Playing
Launch the shortcut "Half-Life Alyx NoVR" that came with your download. You can move it anywhere you want, for example to your desktop.

If you don't have the game from Steam or installed it in a different folder, then you need to change the path to the installation folder in the shortcut's properties.
