# HLA-NoVR
NO VR Script for Half-Life: Alyx

## Installation
Copy the ``game`` folder into your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx``).

Steam Deck/Linux users need to enable Proton for both Half-Life: Alyx and the mod in order for the game to work (``game\bin\win64\novr.exe``) and also add the launch option ``-processheap``.
## Playing
Launch the provided shortcut called "Half-Life Alyx NoVR". You can move it anywhere you want.

If you don't have the game from Steam or installed it in a different folder, then you need to change the path to the installation folder in the shortcut's properties.
