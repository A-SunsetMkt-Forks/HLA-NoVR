# HLA-NoVR
NoVR Script for Half-Life: Alyx

## Installation
[Install the official launcher for easy updates](https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR-Launcher#installation-and-usage).

You can also get the [NoVR Map Edits addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956743603) for smoother traversal and less out of bounds glitches.

## Controls
To change the controls/rebind buttons, edit ``game\hlvr\scripts\vscripts\bindings.lua`` in your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder.

If you get stuck try to move back or crouch! In case that does not help you can enable noclip with V.

### Keyboard and Mouse
Left Click: Select in Main Menu/Throw Held Object/Primary Attack

W, A, S, D: Move

Space: Jump

Ctrl: Crouch

Shift: Sprint

E: Interact/Pick Up Object

F: Flashlight (if you have it)

H: Cover your mouth

F5: Quick Save

## Old installation method
If the launcher doesn't work, then you can try the old installation method:

Copy the ``game`` folder into your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx``).

Then start the game with the launch options ``-novr -vsync``.
